## ‚ú® TASK - 1 : Data Explorization and Summary

 ### ‚û°Ô∏è Objective: 
 Understanding and summarizing key statistics in the dataset.

 ### ‚û°Ô∏è Steps I Followed:

#### ‚ú§ Data Import: 
I began by importing the dataset into Power BI. This powerful tool allowed me to efficiently handle and analyze the data.

#### ‚ú§ Exploratory Analysis: 
I then explored the dataset to understand its structure and data types. This step was crucial to identify key variables and ensure accurate analysis.

#### ‚ú§ Calculate Statistics: 
Using the insights from the exploratory phase, I computed essential metrics such as average age, the percentage of individuals with various investments, and common savings objectives. These statistics provided a deeper understanding of the dataset's characteristics.

#### ‚ú§ Visualization: 
To effectively communicate the findings, I created a series of insightful charts. These visualizations made the data more accessible and easier to interpret.

 ### ‚û°Ô∏è Insights :-

‚û§ The average age of individuals in the dataset is around 28 years, with a majority being male investors (62.5%). 

‚û§ Gold and Debentures are the most popular investment choices, followed closely by Government Bonds. 

‚û§ Retirement planning is the primary savings objective for most individuals, followed by health care and education. 

‚û§ The investment distribution shows that over 20% of individuals prefer Gold and Debentures, indicating a preference for relatively safer investment options. 

‚û§ Overall, the data highlights a young investor demographic with a focus on long-term financial security.

- This task has been an good learning experience, enhancing my skills in data exploration, analysis, and visualization using Power BI. Excited for the next steps in my data adventure with Cognifyz!

## ‚ú® TASK-3 : Objective Analysis

‚ñ∫ As part of my internship at Cognifyz, I conducted an in-depth analysis  on the relationship between savings objectives and investment choices!

### ‚û°Ô∏è Objective: To analyse how different savings objectives correlate with specific investment avenues. Below are the detailed insights:

### ‚û°Ô∏è Steps I Followed :

#### ‚ú§ Correlation Analysis: 
Explored the correlations between various savings objectives (like Capital Appreciation, Retirement Planning) and investment avenues (such as Equity, Mutual Funds, Government Bonds) using correlation matrices and scatter plots in Power BI.

#### ‚ú§ Chart Creation: 
Developed insightful visualization including Clustered column chart to clearly display the preferred investment choices for each savings objective.


### üí† Investment Avenues by Savings Objectives :-

### 1. Capital Appreciation:

ñßπ Insight: Strongly correlated with equity investments.

ñßπ Interpretation: Investors seeking capital appreciation are inclined towards equities, highlighting a willingness to accept higher risk for potential high returns.

### 2. Retirement Planning:

ñßπ Insight: Shows a balanced preference across mutual funds and government bonds.

ñßπ Interpretation: Investors planning for retirement prefer a balanced approach, leveraging the security of government bonds and the growth potential of mutual funds.


### 3. Healthcare Savings:

ñßπ Insight: Higher inclination towards secure investments like government bonds.

ñßπ Interpretation: For healthcare savings, investors prioritize security, favoring low-risk investments that provide reliable returns.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Key Insights:

‚û§ Capital Appreciation: Investors looking for capital appreciation prefer equities, showing a strong correlation between high-risk, high-reward investments.

‚û§ Growth: There is a balanced distribution among equities, fixed deposits, mutual funds, and public provident funds, with a slight preference for mutual funds, indicating a diversified approach for growth objectives.

‚û§ Income: Inclination towards secure investments like public provident funds, while still considering equities for higher returns.

- This analysis not only enhanced my skills in data visualization and analysis using Power BI but also provided valuable insights into investor behavior based on their savings objectives. 



## ‚ú® TASK-4 : Investment Duration & Frequency

As a part of Internship at Cognifyz Technologies,I have been tasked to analyse investment durations and monitoring frequencies.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Objective: To gain insights into how long investors hold their investments and how frequently they monitor them.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Steps to Achieve This:

#### ‚ú§ Duration Distribution: 
I visualized the distribution of investment durations using bar charts in Power BI. This helped in identifying that the majority of investors prefer medium-term investments (1-5 years), with the highest number of investments falling in the 3-5 year category.

#### ‚ú§ Frequency Analysis: 
I analyzed investment monitoring frequencies through bar charts. The findings revealed that most investors monitor their investments on a monthly basis. I then examined how this monitoring frequency impacts their investment choices.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Key Insights:

#### ‚û§ Medium-Term Preference: 
Investors predominantly prefer holding their investments for 3-5 years.

#### ‚û§ Monthly Monitoring: 
The majority of investors prefer to monitor their investments monthly, which appears to be a common strategy for managing medium-term investments.

- This project enhanced my skills in data visualization and analysis using Power BI and provided valuable insights into investor behavior.


## ‚ú® TASK 5 : 

‚ñ∫ As part of my internship at Cognifyz, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the reasons why individuals choose to invest. 

### ‚û°Ô∏è Objective: To analyze and visualize the primary reasons driving investment decisions.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Steps Taken:

#### ‚ú§ Trend Analysis:
Identified common reasons for investment, such as Better Returns, Fund Diversification, and Tax Benefits.
Analyzed the dataset to find patterns and frequencies of these reasons.

#### ‚ú§Visualization:
Created detailed charts in Power BI to display the distribution and frequency of investment reasons.
Visualized how investment durations and monitoring frequencies vary by reason.


### ‚û°Ô∏è Key Insights:
‚û§ Better Returns is the dominant reason for investment, indicating that investors are primarily motivated by high potential gains.
‚û§ Fund Diversification is also a significant reason, suggesting that investors are interested in spreading their risks across various assets.
‚û§ Tax Benefits is the least common reason, implying it is not a primary motivator for most investors in the dataset.

#### üí†Investment Duration:
‚û§ The majority of investments, regardless of reason, are held for 3-5 years.
‚û§ A significant portion also prefers a 1-3 year duration.
‚û§ Very few investors hold investments for less than 1 year or more than 5 years.

#### üí†Monitoring Frequency:
‚û§ Most investors prefer to monitor their investments monthly, indicating a preference for regular but not overly frequent oversight.
‚û§ Weekly and daily monitoring are less common, suggesting these are either less necessary or less feasible for most investors.

‚ú® These insights can help in understanding the primary motivations and behaviors of investors, which can be useful for financial planning and advising.


## ‚ú® TASK 6: -

- As part of my internship at Cognifyz, I dived deep into understanding where investors get their information. Here‚Äôs a glimpse into my analysis:

These visuals highlight the most commonly relied upon sources by investors.

#### üí†Source by Avenue :

##### 1. Mutual Funds:
ñßπ The most common source of information for mutual funds is financial consultants, with 18 mentions.
ñßπ This indicates that investors heavily rely on professional advice when it comes to mutual funds.
