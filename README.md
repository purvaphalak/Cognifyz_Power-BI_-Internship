➤ Better Returns is the dominant reason for investment, indicating that investors are primarily motivated by high potential gains.

➤ Fund Diversification is also a significant reason, suggesting that investors are interested in spreading their risks across various assets.

➤ Tax Benefits is the least common reason, implying it is not a primary motivator for most investors in the dataset.

##### 💠Investment Duration:
➤ The majority of investments, regardless of reason, are held for 3-5 years.

➤ A significant portion also prefers a 1-3 year duration.

➤ Very few investors hold investments for less than 1 year or more than 5 years.

##### 💠Monitoring Frequency:
➤ Most investors prefer to monitor their investments monthly, indicating a preference for regular but not overly frequent oversight.

➤ Weekly and daily monitoring are less common, suggesting these are either less necessary or less feasible for most investors.

✅ These insights can help in understanding the primary motivations and behaviors of investors, which can be useful for financial planning and advising.

These visuals highlight the most commonly relied upon sources by investors.

#### 💠Source by Avenue :

##### 1. Mutual Funds:
𖧹 The most common source of information for mutual funds is financial consultants, with 18 mentions.
𖧹 This indicates that investors heavily rely on professional advice when it comes to mutual funds.

##### 2. Equity:
𖧹 Equity investments also see a significant reliance on financial consultants, with 10 mentions.
𖧹 This shows a trend where professional advice is sought for high-risk investments.

Financial consultants are the most trusted source across all investment avenues, indicating a high value placed on expert opinion.

##### 𖧹 Traditional Media is Key: 
Newspapers and magazines are still highly relevant, showing the enduring influence of print media.
